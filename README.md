MVP Project Plan: "FinanceTracker"
Here is a simple "whitepaper" or project plan for our MVP.

1. Project Goal (MVP)
To create a command-line Java application that allows a user to:

Set a monthly budget for different categories.

Manually add expenses for those categories.

View a summary of their spending vs. their budget.

2. Core Features (MVP)
Create Budget: The user can define categories (e.g., "Groceries", "Rent", "Gas") and set a monthly spending limit for each.

Add Expense: The user can add a new expense, specifying the amount and its category.

View Summary: The app will calculate the total spent in each category, show how much money is left (or how much they are over budget), and display a simple report.

Data Persistence: The app will save the budget and expenses to a simple text file (like .csv or .txt) so the data isn't lost when the app closes.

3. Technology (MVP)
Language: Java

Interface: Command-Line Interface (CLI). The user will interact by typing commands into their terminal.

Data Storage: Local Text Files (e.g., budget.txt, expenses.txt). This avoids the complexity of a database for now.

Project Timeline & Steps
Let's break down the development into phases. We will go through each one together, writing and explaining the code as we go.

Phase 1: The Blueprints (Core Classes)
First, we need to define the "things" our app will track. In Java, we do this with classes.

Create the Expense class: This will be a simple blueprint. What does every expense have?

description (String)

amount (double)

category (String)

date (LocalDate)

Create the Budget class: This class will manage all our categories and their limits.

It will probably use a HashMap to store categories and their limits (e.g., {"Groceries": 500.00, "Rent": 1500.00}).

Phase 2: The Core Engine (Logic)
Next, we'll create the main part of our app that runs the show.

Create the FinanceTracker (main) class: This will be the entry point of our app.

Show a Menu: When the app starts, it will show the user a simple menu:

1. Add Expense

2. Set Budget

3. View Summary

4. Exit

Handle User Input: We'll use the Scanner class to read what the user types.

Phase 3: Building the Features
Now we'll write the code for each menu option.

Code "Set Budget": We'll write a method that asks the user for a category name and a budget amount and saves it in our Budget class.

Code "Add Expense": We'll write a method that asks for an expense description, amount, and category, and then creates a new Expense object and saves it (e.g., in an ArrayList).

Code "View Summary": This is the most fun part! We'll write a method that:

Loops through all the Expense objects.

Calculates the total spent for each category.

Compares the total spent to the Budget limit.

Prints a simple report like:

--- Your Monthly Summary ---
Groceries: $250.00 spent of $500.00 budget. ($250.00 remaining)
Gas:       $75.00 spent of $100.00 budget. ($25.00 remaining)
Rent:      $1500.00 spent of $1500.00 budget. ($0.00 remaining)
Phase 4: Saving Your Data (Persistence)
An app isn't very useful if it forgets everything when you close it.

Write to File: We'll write methods to save the Budget categories and the ArrayList of Expenses to text files.

Read from File: We'll write methods that, when the app first starts, read from those files to load all the user's previous data.

Future Goals (After the MVP)
Once we have this strong foundation, we can start adding your more ambitious ideas:

v2.0: JavaFX GUI: Turn the command-line app into a desktop app with buttons and charts.

v3.0: Bill Optimization: Add your idea for tracking bill dates and optimizing your checking account balance.

v4.0: The Big Leap: Start building the Android app and the server-side code needed for your voice/text entry feature.
